# ``dyce`` ‚Äì simple Python tools for exploring dice outcomes and other discrete probabilities

``dyce`` is a pure-Python library for computing discrete probability distributions.
It is designed to be immediately and broadly useful with minimal additional investment beyond basic knowledge of Python.
While not as compact as a dedicated grammar, ``dyce``‚Äôs Python-based primitives are quite sufficient, and often more expressive.
Those familiar with various [game notations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) should be able to adapt quickly.

That being said, if you‚Äôre looking at something on which to build your own grammar, ``dyce`` can serve you well.
Check out the [``dyce.r`` sub-package](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce.r/) and the [rolling tutorial](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/rollin/).

``dyce`` should be able to replicate or replace most other dice probability modeling tools.
It strives to be [fully documented](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/) and relies heavily on examples to develop understanding.
If you find it lacking in any way, please consider [contributing an issue](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/contrib/) to start a discussion.

``dyce`` is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
See the accompanying ``LICENSE`` file for details.
Non-experimental features should be considered stable (but an unquenchable thirst to increase performance remains).
See the [release notes](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/notes/) for a summary of version-to-version changes.
Source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/posita/dyce).

## A taste

``dyce`` provides several core primitives.
[``H`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H) represent histograms for modeling discrete outcomes, like individual dice.
[``P`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.p.P) represent pools (ordered sequences) of histograms.
[``R`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.r.R) (covered [elsewhere](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/rollin/)) represent nodes in arbitrary roller trees useful for translating from proprietary grammars and generating weighted random rolls that ‚Äúshow their work‚Äù without the overhead of enumeration.
All support a variety of operations.

``` python
>>> from dyce import H
>>> d6 = H(6)  # a standard six-sided die
>>> 2@d6 * 3 - 4  # 2d6 √ó 3 - 4
H({2: 1, 5: 2, 8: 3, 11: 4, 14: 5, 17: 6, 20: 5, 23: 4, 26: 3, 29: 2, 32: 1})
>>> d6.lt(d6)  # how often a first six-sided die shows a face less than a second
H({False: 21, True: 15})
>>> abs(d6 - d6)  # subtract the least of two six-sided dice from the greatest
H({0: 6, 1: 10, 2: 8, 3: 6, 4: 4, 5: 2})

```

``` python
>>> from dyce import P
>>> p_2d6 = 2@P(d6)  # a pool of two six-sided dice
>>> p_2d6.h()  # pools can be collapsed into histograms
H({2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 5, 7: 6, 8: 5, 9: 4, 10: 3, 11: 2, 12: 1})
>>> p_2d6 == 2@d6  # pools and histograms are comparable
True

```

By providing an optional argument to the [``P.h`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.p.P.h), one can ‚Äútake‚Äù individual dice from pools, ordered least to greatest.
(The [``H.format`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.format) provides rudimentary visualization for convenience.)

``` python
>>> p_2d6.h(0)  # take the lowest die of 2d6
H({1: 11, 2: 9, 3: 7, 4: 5, 5: 3, 6: 1})
>>> print(p_2d6.h(0).format(width=65))
avg |    2.53
std |    1.40
var |    1.97
  1 |  30.56% |###############
  2 |  25.00% |############
  3 |  19.44% |#########
  4 |  13.89% |######
  5 |   8.33% |####
  6 |   2.78% |#

```

``` python
>>> p_2d6.h(-1)  # take the highest die of 2d6
H({1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 7, 5: 9, 6: 11})
>>> print(p_2d6.h(-1).format(width=65))
avg |    4.47
std |    1.40
var |    1.97
  1 |   2.78% |#

  3 |  13.89% |######
  4 |  19.44% |#########
  5 |  25.00% |############
  6 |  30.56% |###############

```

[``H`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H) provide a [``distribution`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution) and a [``distribution_xy`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution_xy) to ease integration with plotting packages like [``matplotlib``](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html).

``` python
>>> import matplotlib  # doctest: +SKIP

>>> outcomes, probabilities = p_2d6.h(0).distribution_xy()
>>> matplotlib.pyplot.bar(
...   [v - 0.125 for v in outcomes],
...   probabilities,
...   alpha=0.75,
...   width=0.5,
...   label="Lowest",
... )  # doctest: +SKIP

>>> outcomes, probabilities = p_2d6.h(-1).distribution_xy()
>>> matplotlib.pyplot.bar(
...   [v + 0.125 for v in outcomes],
...   probabilities,
...   alpha=0.75,
...   width=0.5,
...   label="Highest",
... )  # doctest: +SKIP

>>> matplotlib.pyplot.legend()  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> matplotlib.pyplot.title(r"Taking the lowest or highest die of 2d6")  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> matplotlib.pyplot.show()  # doctest: +SKIP

```

[``H`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H) and [``P`` objects](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.p.P) can generate random rolls.

``` python
>>> d6 = H(6)
>>> d6.roll()  # doctest: +SKIP
4

```

``` python
>>> d10 = H(10) - 1
>>> p_6d10 = 6@P(d10)
>>> p_6d10.roll()  # doctest: +SKIP
(0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7)

```

See the tutorials on [counting](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/countin/) and [rolling](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/rollin/), as well as the [API guide](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/) for much more thorough treatments, including detailed examples.

## Design philosophy

``dyce`` is fairly low-level by design, prioritizing ergonomics and composability.
It explicitly avoids stochastic simulation, but instead determines outcomes through enumeration and discrete computation.
That‚Äôs a highfalutin way of saying it doesn‚Äôt guess.
It *knows*, even if knowing is harder.
Which, if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, it often is.
Or, at least, it *should* be.

!!! quote

    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what is going on.‚Äù

    ‚ÄîAmos Tversky

Because ``dyce`` exposes Python primitives rather than defining a dedicated grammar and interpreter, one can more easily integrate it with other tools.[^1]
It can be installed and run anywhere[^2], and modified as desired.
On its own, ``dyce`` is completely adequate for casual tinkering.
However, it really shines when used in larger contexts such as with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

[^1]:

    You won‚Äôt find any lexers, parsers, or tokenizers in ``dyce``‚Äôs core, other than straight-up Python.
    That being said, you can always ‚Äúroll‚Äù your own (see what we did there?) and lean on ``dyce`` underneath to perform computations.
    It doesn‚Äôt mind.
    It actually [kind of *likes* it](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/rollin/).

[^2]:

    Okay, maybe not _literally_ anywhere, but [you‚Äôd be surprised](https://jokejet.com/guys-i-need-a-network-specialist-with-some-python-experience-its-urgent/).
    Void where prohibited.
    [Certain restrictions](#requirements) apply.
    [Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball](https://youtu.be/GmqeZl8OI2M).

In an intentional departure from [RFC 1925, ¬ß 2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925#section-2), ``dyce`` includes some conveniences, such as minor computation optimizations (e.g., the [``H.lowest_terms`` method](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.lowest_terms), various other shorthands, etc.) and formatting conveniences (e.g., the [``H.distribution``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution), [``H.distribution_xy``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.distribution_xy), and [``H.format``](https://posita.github.io/dyce/0.3/dyce/#dyce.h.H.format) methods).
