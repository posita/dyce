  It looks like crap in a text editor, but it has no effect on rendering, and it allows much more useful diffs.
  Thank you!

# `dyce` - Simple Python tools for dice-based probabilities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/posita/dyce.svg?version=master)](https://travis-ci.com/posita/dyce?version=master)

> :point_up: *Curious about integrating your project with the above services?
  Jeff Knupp ([**@jeffknupp**](https://github.com/jeffknupp)) [describes how](https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/).*

`dyce` is a pure-Python library for exploring dice probabilities designed to be immediately and broadly useful with minimal additional investment beyond basic knowledge of Python.
Inspired by [AnyDice](https://anydice.com/), `dyce` leverages Pythonic syntax and operators for rolling dice and computing weighted outcomes.
While Python is not as terse as a dedicated grammar, it is quite sufficient.
Those familiar with various [game notations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) should be able to adapt quickly.
See [the docs](https://posita.github.io/dyce/latest/) for more information.

`dyce` is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
See the accompanying `LICENSE` file for details.
Source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/posita/dyce).
