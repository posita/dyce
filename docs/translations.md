## Checking Angry’s math on the [Tension Pool](https://theangrygm.com/definitive-tension-pool/)

In the [Angry GM](https://theangrygm.com/)’s publication of the [PDF version of his Tension Pool mechanic](https://theangrygm.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Tension-Pool.pdf), he includes some probabilities.
Can ``dyce`` check his work?
You bet!

Let’s reproduce his tables (with slightly different names to provide context).

| d6s in pool | Angry’s probability of at least one ``1`` showing |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| 1           | 16.7%                                             |
| 2           | 30.6%                                             |
| 3           | 42.1%                                             |
| 4           | 51.8%                                             |
| 5           | 59.8%                                             |
| 6           | 66.5%                                             |

How do we do compute these results using ``dyce``?

``` python
>>> from dyce import H
>>> one_in_d6 = H(6).eq(1)
>>> for n in range(1, 7):
...   ones_in_nd6 = n@one_in_d6
...   at_least_one_one_in_nd6 = ones_in_nd6.ge(1)
...   print(f"{n}: {at_least_one_one_in_nd6[1] / at_least_one_one_in_nd6.total():6.2%}")
1: 16.67%
2: 30.56%
3: 42.13%
4: 51.77%
5: 59.81%
6: 66.51%

```

So far so good.
Let’s keep going.

| 1d8 + 1d12 | Rarity or Severity   |
|:----------:|:--------------------:|
| 2-4        | Very Rare or Extreme |
| 5-6        | Rare or Major        |
| 7-8        | Uncommon or Moderate |
| 9-13       | Common or Minor      |
| 14-15      | Uncommon or Moderate |
| 16-17      | Rare or Major        |
| 18-20      | Very Rare or Extreme |

We need to map semantic outcomes to numbers (and back again).
How can we represent those in ``dyce``?
One way is [``IntEnum``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#intenum)s.
``IntEnum``s have a property that allows them to substitute directly for ``int``s, which, with a little nudging, is very convenient.

``` python
>>> from enum import IntEnum

>>> class Complication(IntEnum):
...   NONE = 0  # this will come in handy later
...   COMMON = 1
...   UNCOMMON = 2
...   RARE = 3
...   VERY_RARE = 4

>>> OUTCOME_TO_RARITY_MAP = {
...   2: Complication.VERY_RARE,
...   3: Complication.VERY_RARE,
...   4: Complication.VERY_RARE,
...   5: Complication.RARE,
...   6: Complication.RARE,
...   7: Complication.UNCOMMON,
...   8: Complication.UNCOMMON,
...   9: Complication.COMMON,
...   10: Complication.COMMON,
...   11: Complication.COMMON,
...   12: Complication.COMMON,
...   13: Complication.COMMON,
...   14: Complication.UNCOMMON,
...   15: Complication.UNCOMMON,
...   16: Complication.RARE,
...   17: Complication.RARE,
...   18: Complication.VERY_RARE,
...   19: Complication.VERY_RARE,
...   20: Complication.VERY_RARE,
... }

```

Now let’s use our map to validate the probabilities of a particular outcome using that d8 and d12.

| Rarity or impact     | Angry’s probability of a Complication arising |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| Common or Minor      | 41.7%                                         |
| Uncommon or Moderate | 27.1%                                         |
| Rare or Major        | 18.8%                                         |
| Very Rare or Extreme | 12.5%                                         |

``` python
>>> prob_of_complication = H.foreach(
...   lambda outcome: OUTCOME_TO_RARITY_MAP[outcome],
...   outcome=H(8) + H(12),
... )
>>> {outcome: f"{float(prob):6.2%}" for outcome, prob in prob_of_complication.distribution()}
{<Complication.COMMON: 1>: '41.67%',
 <Complication.UNCOMMON: 2>: '27.08%',
 <Complication.RARE: 3>: '18.75%',
 <Complication.VERY_RARE: 4>: '12.50%'}

```

Lookin’ good!
Now let’s put everything together.

| d6s in pool | None  | Common | Uncommon | Rare  | Very Rare |
|:-----------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| 1           | 83.3% | 7.0%   | 4.5%     | 3.1%  | 2.1%      |
| 2           | 69.4% | 12.7%  | 8.3%     | 5.7%  | 3.8%      |
| 3           | 57.9% | 17.6%  | 11.4%    | 7.9%  | 5.3%      |
| 4           | 48.2% | 21.6%  | 14.0%    | 9.7%  | 6.5%      |
| 5           | 40.2% | 24.9%  | 16.2%    | 11.2% | 7.5%      |
| 6           | 33.5% | 27.7%  | 18.0%    | 12.5% | 8.3%      |

``` python
>>> from typing import cast
>>> for n in range(1, 7):
...   ones_in_nd6 = n@one_in_d6
...   at_least_one_one_in_nd6 = ones_in_nd6.ge(1)
...   prob_complication_in_nd6 = at_least_one_one_in_nd6 * prob_of_complication
...   complications_for_nd6 = {
...     Complication(cast(int, outcome)).name: f"{float(prob):6.2%}"
...     for outcome, prob in (prob_complication_in_nd6).distribution()
...   }
...   print("{} -> {}".format(n, complications_for_nd6))
1 -> {'NONE': '83.33%', 'COMMON': ' 6.94%', 'UNCOMMON': ' 4.51%', 'RARE': ' 3.12%', 'VERY_RARE': ' 2.08%'}
2 -> {'NONE': '69.44%', 'COMMON': '12.73%', 'UNCOMMON': ' 8.28%', 'RARE': ' 5.73%', 'VERY_RARE': ' 3.82%'}
3 -> {'NONE': '57.87%', 'COMMON': '17.55%', 'UNCOMMON': '11.41%', 'RARE': ' 7.90%', 'VERY_RARE': ' 5.27%'}

5 -> {'NONE': '40.19%', 'COMMON': '24.92%', 'UNCOMMON': '16.20%', 'RARE': '11.21%', 'VERY_RARE': ' 7.48%'}
6 -> {'NONE': '33.49%', 'COMMON': '27.71%', 'UNCOMMON': '18.01%', 'RARE': '12.47%', 'VERY_RARE': ' 8.31%'}

```

Well butter my butt, and call me a biscuit!
That Angry guy sure knows his math!

## Modeling *Ironsworn*’s core mechanic

Shawn Tomlin’s [*Ironsworn*](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) melds a number of different influences in a fresh way.
Its core mechanic involves rolling an *action die* (a d6), adding a modifier, and comparing the resulting value to two *challenge dice* (d10s).
If the modified value from the action die is strictly greater than both challenge dice, the result is a strong success.
If it is strictly greater than only one challenge die, the result is a weak success.
If it is equal to or less than both challenge dice, it’s a failure.

A verbose way to model this is to enumerate the product of the three dice and then perform logical comparisons.
However, if we recognize that our problem involves a [dependent probability](countin.md#dependent-probabilities), we can craft a solution in terms of [``H.foreach``][dyce.h.H.foreach].
We can also deploy a counting trick with the two d10s.

``` python
>>> from dyce import H, as_int
>>> from numerary.types import RealLike
>>> from enum import IntEnum, auto
>>> from typing import Iterator, Tuple, cast
>>> d6 = H(6)
>>> d10 = H(10)
>>> mods = list(range(0, 5))

>>> class IronResult(IntEnum):
...   FAILURE = 0
...   WEAK_SUCCESS = auto()
...   STRONG_SUCCESS = auto()

>>> iron_distributions_by_mod = {
...   mod: H.foreach(lambda action: 2@(d10.lt(action)), action=d6 + mod)
...   for mod in mods
... }
>>> for mod, iron_distribution in iron_distributions_by_mod.items():
...   print("{:+} -> {}".format(mod, {
...     IronResult(cast(int, outcome)).name: f"{float(prob):6.2%}"
...     for outcome, prob in iron_distribution.distribution()
...   }))
+0 -> {'FAILURE': '59.17%', 'WEAK_SUCCESS': '31.67%', 'STRONG_SUCCESS': ' 9.17%'}
+1 -> {'FAILURE': '45.17%', 'WEAK_SUCCESS': '39.67%', 'STRONG_SUCCESS': '15.17%'}
+2 -> {'FAILURE': '33.17%', 'WEAK_SUCCESS': '43.67%', 'STRONG_SUCCESS': '23.17%'}
+3 -> {'FAILURE': '23.17%', 'WEAK_SUCCESS': '43.67%', 'STRONG_SUCCESS': '33.17%'}
+4 -> {'FAILURE': '15.17%', 'WEAK_SUCCESS': '39.67%', 'STRONG_SUCCESS': '45.17%'}

```

!!! question "What’s with that ``#!python 2@(d10.lt(action))``?"

    Let’s break it down.
    ``#!python H(10).lt(value)`` will tell us how often a single d10 is less than ``#!python value``.

    ``` python
    >>> H(10).lt(5)  # how often a d10 is strictly less than 5
    H({False: 6, True: 4})

    ```

    By summing those results (and taking advantage of the fact that, in Python, ``#!python bool``s act like ``#!python int``s when it comes to arithmetic operators), we can count how often that happens with more than one interchangeable d10.

    ``` python
    >>> h = H(10).lt(5) + H(10).lt(5) ; h
    H({0: 36, 1: 48, 2: 16})
    >>> h.total()
    100

    ```

    How do we interpret those results?
    36 times out of a hundred, neither d10 will be strictly less than five.
    48 times out of a hundred, exactly one of the d10s will be strictly less than five.
    16 times out of a hundred, both d10s will be strictly less than five.

    [``H``][dyce.h.H]’s ``#!python @`` operator provides a shorthand.

    ``` python
    >>> # The parentheses are technically redundant, but clarify the intention
    >>> 2@(H(10).lt(5)) == H(10).lt(5) + H(10).lt(5)
    True

    ```

!!! question "Why doesn’t ``#!python 2@(H(6).gt(H(10))`` work?"

    ``#!python H(6).gt(H(10))`` will compute how often a six-sided die is strictly greater than a ten-sided die.
    ``#!python 2@(H(6).gt(H(10)))`` will show the frequencies that a first six-sided die is strictly greater than a first ten-sided die and a second six-sided die is strictly greater than a second ten-sided die.
    This isn’t quite what we want, since the mechanic calls for rolling a single six-sided die and comparing that result to each of two ten-sided dice.

Now for a _twist_.
In cooperative or solo play, a failure or success is particularly spectacular when the d10s come up doubles.
The key to mapping that to ``dyce`` internals is recognizing that we have a dependent probability that involves *three* independent variables: the (modded) d6, a first d10, and a second d10.

[``H.foreach``][dyce.h.H.foreach] is especially useful where there are multiple independent terms.

``` python
>>> class IronSoloResult(IntEnum):
...   FAILURE = 0
...   WEAK_SUCCESS = auto()
...   STRONG_SUCCESS = auto()
...   SPECTACULAR_SUCCESS = auto()
...   SPECTACULAR_FAILURE = -1

>>> def iron_solo_dependent_term(action, first_challenge, second_challenge, mod=0):
...   modded_action = action + mod
...   beats_first_challenge = modded_action > first_challenge
...   beats_second_challenge = modded_action > second_challenge
...   doubles = first_challenge == second_challenge
...   if beats_first_challenge and beats_second_challenge:
...     return IronSoloResult.SPECTACULAR_SUCCESS if doubles else IronSoloResult.STRONG_SUCCESS
...   elif beats_first_challenge or beats_second_challenge:
...     return IronSoloResult.WEAK_SUCCESS
...   else:
...     return IronSoloResult.SPECTACULAR_FAILURE if doubles else IronSoloResult.FAILURE

```

By defining our dependent term function to include ``#!python mod`` as a parameter with a default argument, we can use ``#!python partial`` to manipulate it, which is helpful for visualization.

## Advanced topic – modeling *Risis*

*[Risus](http://risus.cumberlandgames.com/)* and its many [community-developed alternative rules](http://www.risusiverse.com/home/optional-rules) not only make for entertaining reading, but are fertile ground for stressing ergonomics and capabilities of any discrete outcome modeling tool.
We can easily model the first round of its opposed combat system for various starting configurations.

``` python
>>> for them in range(3, 6):
...   print("---")
...   for us in range(them, them + 3):
...     first_round = (us@H(6)).vs(them@H(6))  # -1 is a loss, 0 is a tie, 1 is a win
...     results = first_round.format(width=0)
...     print(f"{us}d6 vs {them}d6: {results}")
---
3d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1: 45.36%, 0:  9.28%, 1: 45.36%}
4d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1: 19.17%, 0:  6.55%, 1: 74.28%}
5d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1:  6.07%, 0:  2.99%, 1: 90.93%}
---
4d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1: 45.95%, 0:  8.09%, 1: 45.95%}
5d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1: 22.04%, 0:  6.15%, 1: 71.81%}
6d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1:  8.34%, 0:  3.26%, 1: 88.40%}
---
5d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 46.37%, 0:  7.27%, 1: 46.37%}
6d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 24.24%, 0:  5.79%, 1: 69.96%}
7d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 10.36%, 0:  3.40%, 1: 86.24%}

```

This highlights the mechanic’s notorious “death spiral”, which we can visualize as a heat map.

### Modeling entire multi-round combats

With a little ~~elbow~~ *finger* grease, we can roll up our … erm … fingerless gloves and even model various starting configurations through to completion to get a better sense of the impact of any initial disparity (in this case, applying dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations).

``` python
>>> from dyce import H, P
>>> import sys
>>> from enum import IntEnum, auto
>>> from typing import Callable, Dict, Tuple
>>> if sys.version_info >= (3, 9):
...   from functools import cache
... else:
...   from functools import lru_cache
...   cache = lru_cache(maxsize=None)

>>> class Risus(IntEnum):
...   LOSS = -1
...   DRAW = auto()
...   WIN = auto()

>>> @cache
... def risus_combat_driver(
...     us: int,  # number of dice we still have
...     them: int,  # number of dice they still have
...     us_vs_them_func: Callable[[int, int], H],
... ) -> H:
...   if us < 0 or them < 0:
...     raise ValueError(f"cannot have negative numbers (us: {us}, them: {them})")
...   if us == 0 and them == 0:
...     return H({0: 1})  # should not happen unless combat(0, 0) is called from the start
...

7d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1:  1.49%, 1: 98.51%}

```

There’s lot going on there.
Let’s dissect it.

``` python linenums="16"
@cache
def risus_combat_driver(
    us: int,  # number of dice we still have
    them: int,  # number of dice they still have
    us_vs_them_func: Callable[[int, int], H],
) -> H:
  ...
```

Our “driver” takes three arguments:

1. How many dice we have left (``#!python us``);
1. How many dice the opposition has left (``#!python them``); and
1. A resolution function (``#!python us_vs_them_func``) that takes counts of each party’s remaining dice and returns a histogram encoding the probability of winning or losing a single round akin to the [``H.vs`` method][dyce.h.H.vs]:

    * An outcome of ``#!python -1`` signals the opposition’s victory
    * An outcome of ``#!python 1`` signals our victory.
    * An outcome of ``#!python 0`` signals a tie.

The [``#!python @cache`` decorator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cache) does simple memoization for us because there are redundancies.
For example, we might compute a case where we lose a die, then our opposition loses a die.
We arrive at a similar case where our opposition loses a die, then we lose a die.
Both cases would be identical from that point on.
In this context, ``@cache`` helps us avoid recomputing redundant sub-trees.

``` python linenums="22"
  if us < 0 or them < 0:
    raise ValueError(f"cannot have negative numbers (us: {us}, them: {them})")
  if us == 0 and them == 0:
    return H({0: 1})  # should not happen unless combat(0, 0) is called from the start
```

We make some preliminary checks that guard access to our recursive implementation so that it can be a little cleaner.

``` python linenums="27"
  def _resolve(us: int, them: int) -> H:
    ...
```

``` python linenums="39"
  return _resolve(us, them)
```

Skipping over its implementation for now, we define a our memoized recursive implementation (``#!python _resolve``) and then call it with our initial arguments.

``` python linenums="27"
  def _resolve(us: int, them: int) -> H:
    if us == 0: return H({-1: 1})  # we are out of dice, they win
    if them == 0: return H({1: 1})  # they are out of dice, we win
```

Getting back to that implementation, these are our base cases.
We check whether either party has run out of dice, in which case the combat is over.
If we have none of those cases, we get to work.

!!! note

    In this function, we do not check for the case where *both* parties are at zero.
    Because only one party can lose a die during each round, the only way both parties can be at zero simultaneously is if they both started at zero.
    Since we guard against that case in the enclosing function, we don’t have to worry about it here.
    Either ``#!python us`` is zero, ``#!python them`` is zero, or neither is zero.

``` python linenums="30"
    this_round = us_vs_them_func(us, them)
```

Then, we compute the outcomes for _this round_ using the provided resolution function.

``` python linenums="32"
    def _next_round(this_round_outcome) -> H:
      ...
```

``` python linenums="38"
    return H.foreach(_next_round, this_round_outcome=this_round)
```

Keeping in mind that we’re inside our recursive implementation, we define a dependent term specifically for use with [``H.foreach``][dyce.h.H.foreach].
This allows us to take our computation for this round, and “fold in” subsequent rounds.

``` python linenums="32"
    def _next_round(this_round_outcome) -> H:
      if this_round_outcome < 0: return _resolve(us - 1, them)  # we lost this round, and one die
      elif this_round_outcome > 0: return _resolve(us, them - 1)  # they lost this round, and one die
      else: return H({})  # ignore (immediately re-roll) all ties
```

Our substitution function is pretty straightforward.
Where we are asked whether we want to provide a substitution for a round we lost, we lose a die and recurse.
Where we are asked for a substitution for a round we won, our opposition loses a die and we recurse.
We ignore ties (simulating that we re-roll them in place until they are no longer ties).

``` python linenums="44"
    ... risus_combat_driver(
      u, t,
      lambda u, t: (u@H(6)).vs(t@H(6))
    ) ...
```

At this point, we can define a simple ``#!python lambda`` that wraps [``H.vs``][dyce.h.H.vs] and submit it to our driver to enumerate resolution outcomes from various starting positions.

!!! note

    This is a complicated example that involves some fairly sophisticated programming techniques (recursion, memoization, nested functions, etc.).
    The point is not to suggest that such techniques are required to be productive.
    However, it is useful to show that ``dyce`` is flexible enough to model these types of outcomes in a couple dozen lines of code.
    It is high-level enough to lean on for nuanced number crunching without a lot of detailed knowledge, while still being low-level enough that authors knowledgeable of advanced programming techniques are not precluded from using them.

### Modeling different combat resolution methods

Using our ``#!python risus_combat_driver`` from above, we can craft a alternative resolution function to model the less death-spirally “Best of Set” alternative mechanic from *[The Risus Companion](https://ghalev.itch.io/risus-companion)* with the optional “Goliath Rule” for resolving ties.

``` python
>>> def deadly_combat_vs(us: int, them: int) -> H:
...   best_us = (us@P(6)).h(-1)
...   best_them = (them@P(6)).h(-1)
...   h = best_us.vs(best_them)
...   # Goliath Rule: tie goes to the party with fewer dice in this round
...   h = H.foreach(
...     lambda outcome: (us < them) - (us > them) if outcome == 0 else outcome,
...     outcome=h,
...   )
...   return h

>>> for t in range(3, 6):
...   print("---")
...   for u in range(t, t + 3):
...     results = risus_combat_driver(u, t, deadly_combat_vs).format(width=0)
...     print(f"{u}d6 vs {t}d6: {results}")
---
3d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}
4d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1: 36.00%, 1: 64.00%}
5d6 vs 3d6: {..., -1: 23.23%, 1: 76.77%}
---
4d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}
5d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1: 40.67%, 1: 59.33%}
6d6 vs 4d6: {..., -1: 30.59%, 1: 69.41%}
---
5d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}
6d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 44.13%, 1: 55.87%}
7d6 vs 5d6: {..., -1: 36.89%, 1: 63.11%}

```

The “[Evens Up](http://www.risusiverse.com/home/optional-rules/evens-up)” alternative dice mechanic presents some challenges.

First, ``dyce``’s substitution mechanism only resolves outcomes through a fixed number of iterations, so it can only approximate probabilities for infinite series.
Most of the time, the implications are largely theoretical with a sufficient number of iterations.
This is no exception.

Second, with [one narrow exception][dyce.h.aggregate_with_counts], ``dyce`` only provides a mechanism to directly substitute outcomes, not counts.
This means we can’t arbitrarily *increase* the likelihood of achieving a particular outcome through replacement.
With some creativity, we can work around that, too.

In the case of “Evens Up”, we need to keep track of whether an even number was rolled, but we also need to keep rolling (and accumulating) as long as sixes are rolled.
This behaves a lot like an exploding die with three values (miss, hit, and hit-and-explode).
Further, we can observe that every “run” will be zero or more exploding hits terminated by either a miss or a non-exploding hit.

If we choose our values carefully, we can encode how many times we’ve encountered relevant events as we explode.

``` python
>>> import operator
>>> MISS = 0
>>> HIT = 1
>>> HIT_EXPLODE = 2
>>> d_evens_up_raw = H((
...   MISS,  # 1
...   HIT,  # 2
...   MISS,  # 3
...   HIT,  # 4
...   MISS,  # 5
...   HIT_EXPLODE,  # 6
... ))

>>> d_evens_up_exploded = d_evens_up_raw.explode(max_depth=3) ; d_evens_up_exploded
H({0: 648, 1: 432, 2: 108, 3: 72, 4: 18, 5: 12, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1})

```

For every value that is even, we ended in a miss.
For every value that is odd, we ended in a hit that will need to be tallied.
Dividing by two and ignoring any remainder will tell us how many exploding hits we had along the way.

``` python
>>> def decode_hits(outcome):
...   return (outcome + 1) // 2  # equivalent to outcome // 2 + outcome % 2

>>> d_evens_up = H.foreach(decode_hits, outcome=d_evens_up_exploded)
>>> print(d_evens_up.format())
avg |    0.60
std |    0.69
var |    0.48
  0 |  50.00% |#########################
  1 |  41.67% |####################
  2 |   6.94% |###
  3 |   1.16% |
  4 |   0.23% |

```

We can now approximate a complete “Evens Up” combat using our ``#!python risus_combat_driver`` from above.
We can also deploy a trick using ``#!python partial`` to parameterize use of the Goliath Rule.

``` python
>>> from functools import partial

>>> def evens_up_vs(us: int, them: int, goliath: bool = False) -> H:
...   h = (us@d_evens_up).vs(them@d_evens_up)
...   if goliath:
...     h = H.foreach(lambda outcome: (us < them) - (us > them) if outcome == 0 else outcome, outcome=h)
...   return h

>>> for t in range(3, 5):
...   print("-----------   ---- With Goliath Rule -----   --- Without Goliath Rule ---")
...   for u in range(t, t + 3):
...     goliath_results = risus_combat_driver(u, t, partial(evens_up_vs, goliath=True)).format(width=0)
...     no_goliath_results = risus_combat_driver(u, t, partial(evens_up_vs, goliath=False)).format(width=0)
...     print(f"{u}d6 vs {t}d6:   {goliath_results}   {no_goliath_results}")
-----------   ---- With Goliath Rule -----   --- Without Goliath Rule ---
3d6 vs 3d6:   {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}   {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}
4d6 vs 3d6:   {..., -1: 29.51%, 1: 70.49%}   {..., -1: 19.08%, 1: 80.92%}
5d6 vs 3d6:   {..., -1: 12.32%, 1: 87.68%}   {..., -1:  4.57%, 1: 95.43%}
-----------   ---- With Goliath Rule -----   --- Without Goliath Rule ---
4d6 vs 4d6:   {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}   {..., -1: 50.00%, 1: 50.00%}
5d6 vs 4d6:   {..., -1: 30.52%, 1: 69.48%}   {..., -1: 21.04%, 1: 78.96%}
6d6 vs 4d6:   {..., -1: 13.68%, 1: 86.32%}   {..., -1:  5.88%, 1: 94.12%}

  SA: A >= 1@B
  SB: B >= 1@A
