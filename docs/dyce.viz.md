!!! warning "Experimental"

    This package is an attempt to explore conveniences for integration with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
    It is an explicit departure from [RFC 1925, ยง 2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925#section-2) and should be considered experimental.
    Be warned that future release may introduce incompatibilities or remove this package altogether.
    [Feedback, suggestions, and contributions](contrib.md) are welcome and appreciated.
