# ``dyce`` release notes

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

* Removes calls to ``os.get_terminal_size`` to retain utility in environments without terminals.
  Fixes [#5](https://github.com/posita/dyce/issues/5).
  Thanks [@sudo-simon!](https://github.com/sudo-simon)!

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.4.1)

* Splits out protocol checking into its own fancy library: [``numerary``](https://github.com/posita/numerary/)!
* Is now [available on PyPI as ``dyce``_](https://pypi.org/project/dyce/), thanks to the generosity of [David Eyk](https://eykd.net/about/)!
* Introduces experimental generic [``walk``][dyce.r.walk] function and supporting visitor data structures.
* Uses ``pygraphviz`` to automate class diagram generation.
  (See the note on special considerations for regenerating class diagrams in the [hacking quick start](contrib.md#hacking-quick-start).)
* Introduces experimental use of ``numpy`` for RNG, if present.
* Migrates to using ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg``.
* Adds missing [``py.typed`` to ensure clients get type checking](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/).
  (Whoops.)

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

### Breaking changes

!!! warning

    The following changes are not backward compatible.
    Please review before upgrading.

* Renames ``HAbleT`` and ``HAbleOpsMixin`` to [``HableT``][dyce.h.HableT] and  [``HableOpsMixin``][dyce.h.HableOpsMixin].
    Uses alternate spellings.
* Removes deprecated non-flattening unary operation methods ``P.__neg__`` and ``P.__pos__``.
    Uses, e.g., ``#!python P.umap(operator.__neg__)`` or ``#!python P(-h for h in p)`` instead.
* Removes deprecated synonym methods ``H.even`` and ``H.odd``.
    Uses [``H.is_even``][dyce.h.H.is_even] and [``H.is_odd``][dyce.h.H.is_odd] instead.
* Removes deprecated synonym package ``dyce.plt``.
    Uses [``dyce.viz``][dyce.viz] instead.
* Removes special case handling of ``H({})`` for addition and subtraction.
    Check for code that relied on, e.g., ``#!python h + H({})`` resolving to ``#!python h``.
    It is probably not correct.
    If the behavior is desired, consider eliminating empty histograms before performing calculations.
    E.G., ``#!python h1 + h2 if h2 else h1``.

    See also the [``sum_h`` function][dyce.h.sum_h], which ensures the result is always a histogram:

    ``` python
    >>> from dyce.h import sum_h
    >>> sum(())
    0
    >>> sum_h(())
    H({})

    ```

    Note, however, that sums including empty histograms will be always result in empty histograms:

    ``` python
    >>> from dyce import H
    >>> hs = (H(6), H(6), H(6), H({}))
    >>> sum_h(hs)
    H({})

    ```

    If a different result was desired, adapting our advice from above would yield something like:

    ``` python
    >>> sum_h(h for h in hs if h)
    H({3: 1, 4: 3, 5: 6, 6: 10, ..., 16: 6, 17: 3, 18: 1})

    ```

### Other changes

* Documentation overhaul including augmented examples and reorganized images and JavaScript.
* Fixes ``H({}).format()`` bug.
* Adds [``beartype``](https://github.com/beartype/beartype) runtime type checking.
* *Maintains* support for Python 3.7 (for now).

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.3.2)

* Emergency release to ~~cover up~~ _address_ [this ~~embarrassment~~ _typo_](https://github.com/borntyping/python-dice/issues/16#issuecomment-900249398). ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜…

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.3.1)

* Adds these release notes.
* Boosts ``#!python isinstance`` performance with ``#!python dyce``â€™s proprietary numeric ``#!python Protocol``s.
* Reinstates support for Python 3.7 ~~(for now)~~.
* Adds [``H.is_even``][dyce.h.H.is_even] and [``H.is_odd``][dyce.h.H.is_odd].
* Deprecates synonym methods ``H.even`` and ``H.odd``.
* Introduces experimental [``H.total``][dyce.h.H.total] property.
* Removes incorrectly non-flattening unary operation methods ``#!python P.__abs__`` and ``#!python P.__invert__``.
* Deprecates non-flattening unary operation methods ``#!python P.__neg__`` and ``#!python P.__pos__``.
* Renames experimental ``#!python P.homogeneous`` property to [``P.is_homogeneous``][dyce.p.P.is_homogeneous].
* Introduces experimental [``R``][dyce.r.R] and [``Roll``][dyce.r.Roll] primitives.
* Removes ``#!python coerce`` parameter from [``H.map``][dyce.h.H.map], [``H.rmap``][dyce.h.H.rmap], and [``H.umap``][dyce.h.H.umap].
* Renames ``#!python dyce.plt`` to [``dyce.viz``][dyce.viz].
* Deprecates synonym package ``#!python dyce.plt``.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/posita/dyce/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

``dyce`` goes beta!
Non-experimental features should be considered stable.
