  Please keep each sentence on its own unwrapped line.
  It looks like crap in a text editor, but it has no effect on rendering, and it allows much more useful diffs.

# ``#!python dyce`` package reference

``#!python dyce`` revolves around two core primitives.
[``H`` objects][dyce.h.H] are histograms (outcomes or individual dice).
[``P`` objects][dyce.p.P] are collections of histograms (pools).

Additionally, the [``dyce.evaluation``](dyce.evaluation.md) package provides the [``expandable`` decorator][dyce.evaluation.expandable], which is useful for substitutions, explosions, and modeling arbitrarily complex computations with dependent terms.
It also provides [``foreach``][dyce.evaluation.foreach] and [``explode``][dyce.evaluation.explode] as convenient shorthands.
The [``dyce.r``](dyce.r.md) package provides scalars, histograms, pools, operators, etc. for assembling reusable roller trees.

::: dyce.p.P
